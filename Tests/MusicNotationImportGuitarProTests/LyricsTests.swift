  Guess who  just  got  back __  to- day? __
  Those wild- eyed boys __ that had been a- way __

  Hav- en't changed,  haven't  much to say
  But man, I still think those cats are great
  They were as- king if you were ar-ound __ 
  How you  was,  where you could be found __
  I told them you were li- ving down-  town 
  Dri-ving all the old  men cra-zy
  
  The boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  I said the boys are back in to- __ __ __ __ wn
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  
  You know the chick that used to dance a lot __
  Ev-ery night  she'd be on  the floor sha- king what she'd got 
  Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red  hot 
  I mean she was stea-ming
  And that time  over at john-ny's  place 
  Well this chick got up and she_slapped joh-nny's  face 
  Man __ we just fell a- bout the place
  If that chick don't want to know, forg- et her
  
  The boys are back in town __

  I said the boys are back in to- __ __ __ __ wn
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  
  Spread the word  a- round
  Guess Who's back in town __
  You  spread the word  a- round
  Fri- day night  they'll be dressed  to kill __ 
  Down at Di- no's  bar  and grill __
  The drink  will flow and blood will spill
  And If the boys  want to fight, you'd bet- ter let  them
  That juke- box ion the cor-  ner blas- ting out my fa- vourite song 
  The nights  are getting  war- __ mer, it won't  be long  __
  Won't be long __ till  sum- mer comes
  Now that the boys  are here a- gain
  The boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in town __
  the boys are back in to- __ __ __ __ wn
  the boys are back in town __

  The boys are back  in  ti- me a- gain 
  Been han- gin' down __ at Di-no's
  The boys are back  in  ti-me a-gain
