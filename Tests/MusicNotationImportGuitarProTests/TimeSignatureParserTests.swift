/// There are issues with the domain knowledge acquired and that needed to properly implement
/// a good deal of Time Signatures parsing.
///
/// I have not been able to find enough data to correctly parse and algorithmically determine
/// what is a simple, compound, complex time signature as well as the state of `oddness` of a time signature.
///
/// For now this will have to do and I will ammend the code and tests when I have better domain expertise.
